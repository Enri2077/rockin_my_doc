changed the path of the logs bags in log_monitor

removed "human" from tbmh_mocap.yaml

changed the environments for the mocap logging (on GTL): GTL should never connect to the roscore on the refbox; but run roscore on localhost.
envs: tbmh_env; tbmw_env; fbm_env; (fbm_manual_env)

TODO:

x_log_mocap.launch refactoring based on the new logging configuration.
