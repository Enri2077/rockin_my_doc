changed the path of the logs bags in log_monitor


TODO:
changed the environments for the mocap logging (on GTL): should never connect to the roscore on the refbox; but run roscore on localhost.
new envs: tbmh_env; tbmw_env; fbm_env; (fbm_manual_env)

x_log_mocap.launch refactoring based on the new logging configuration.
