4.1. The CFH lets the robot starts following the path
4.2. The robot's position is being collected with the ground truth system to generate robot_path
5.1. The robot stops at the end point of the path and reports the termination to the CFH.
5.2. The accuracy is computed between robot_path and target_path
6.   The score is evaluated

From the benchmarking point of view, a run consists in steps 1-5. 5 runs are executed.
The scoring provided by the benchmarking box is based on:
 the most accurate run;
 the number of completely executed runs (path movements) (maximum 5);
 the execution time (if less than the maximum allowed for the benchmark).
 

Accuracy evaluation:
Given robot_path and target_path, l a parameter in [0, 1],
let r(l) = ( x_r(l), y_r(l) ) the parametric representation of the robot path, and
let t(l) = ( x_t(l), y_t(l) ) the parametric representation of the target path.
Note: r(0) = t(0) = starting_position; r(1) is the end point of the robot's path; t(1) is the end point of the target path.

The accuracy is computed as 1/N sum{ d(r(l), t(l)) }, l in L.
Where,
 L is a subset (1) of the values of l to which corresponds a measure of the robot's path from the ground truth system;
 N = |L|;
 d is the Euclidean distance.

(1): because of the great amount of positions provided by the ground truth system, just a subset is enough to precisely approximate the robot's path.
